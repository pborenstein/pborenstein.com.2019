I used to tell people that I wrote manuals. They'd recoil and say, "Oh, _you're_ the one." Now I say that I write manuals for programmers and that there's virtually no chance they've seen anything I've written.

But if you're someone looking for someone who writes manuals for programmers, you'd probably be very interested in [my portfolio](https://pborenstein.com/portfolio).
