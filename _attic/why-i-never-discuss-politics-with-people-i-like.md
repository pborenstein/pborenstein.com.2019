I never talk about politics with my friends, with my family, or on Facebook. Well, I'll touch on the topic: "How 'bout them politicians?" or "That's a humdinger of a case SCOTUS decided to hear, huh?" In other words, I'll discuss politics about the same way I discuss the weather.

But if you want to get deeper into what I think, what I believe, and how I vote, it's not likely to happen.

See, it's not me. It's you.

If you agree with me politically, we'll just pat ourselves on the back, marvel at the wonderful insights we share about the human condition, and revel in the snug smugness of being right and of being humble and magnanimous about it

If we disagree, we'll both get that queasy nausea upon discovering that a close friend and confidant is a not only an idiot, a hopeless degenerate, and a closet bedwetter, but also the owner of a meticulously curated collection of tin foil hats.

And I would just hate to think that about you.
