One of the things I realized soon after I got laid off was that I had to get out of the house. Most days I go to the [Wellesley Free Library](https://www.wellesleyfreelibrary.org/home/) to do my work. What I found is that I frequently left files on my machine at home. Carrying a USB flash drive worked until I lost it.

I've been using [Dropbox](https://www.getdropbox.com/) for several months now, and I love it. 

What makes it more useful than a flash drive is that my files live on my machine at home, on my laptop, and the Dropbox site. [![dropbox](/IMAGE/dropboxlogo.png)](https://www.getdropbox.com/referrals/NTU2NTg4ODk)The Dropbox software takes care of making sure that all three sites are synchronized. The best part is that as far as I'm concerned, Dropbox is just a folder on my desktop. 

I keep all the files for current projects there, and edit them right from the Dropbox folder. When I get home, the files I was working on in the library are right there on my desktop machine.

If you do sign up for Dropbox, use [my referral link](https://www.getdropbox.com/referrals/NTU2NTg4ODk) and we'll both get extra space.
