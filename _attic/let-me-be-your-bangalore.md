I used to worry that the company would close up its technical writing department and outsource us to Bangalore.

A couple of weeks ago I had lunch with some of my former coworkers. It's always nice to see them, though the office gossip is much less interesting than it used to be.  I had heard that my old boss had recently hired a new writer.

"I hear I've been replaced," I said.

"We hired a writer out in Hungary," he said. I guess Bangalore has gotten too expensive, and Budapest is the new Bangalore.

"Yeah, that's what I heard. You should have called me."

"Well, she works for about a third of what you used to make," he said.

"What a coincidence," I said. "_I'm_ making about a third of what I used to make, too."

That got me thinking. With the economy the way it is, now is the right time to hire me. Just as the right time to buy a home is when the prices are low and the supply is high, Now is the perfect time to hire someone of my [caliber](https://pborenstein.com/about/) and [quality](https://pborenstein.com/resume/) at Bangalore prices.
