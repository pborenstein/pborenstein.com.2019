I've been reading [Boing Boing](https://boingboing.net/) for years. It's usually more convenient for me to read it through an RSS aggregator like Reeder or Google Reader, so I rarely go to the site itself.

Lately, whenever I do go to the site, I notice on their sidebar a picture and a link to the [Future of Science 2021](https://www.iftf.org/futureofscience). This is what the picture looks like in the sidebar:
