Once in a while, some of the contacts that I've added to my iPhone don't sync back to the Address Book on my Mac. I'm not sure why this happens, but it's almost always when I really need things to just work.

Luckily there's an easy fix, but it's not obvious.

Open the **iSync** application in the **Applications** folder. ![isynciconsm](/IMAGE/isynciconsm.png)If you don't use MobileMe, or if you never used a Palm PDA, you probably didn't know this application existed. Go to **Preferences**, and choose **Reset Sync History**. 

You'll get a reassuring dialog box that tell you you that nothing bad will happen to the data on your Mac or on your "mobile device." Probably. Go ahead and do it.

Now resync your iPhone, and everything should be OK.
