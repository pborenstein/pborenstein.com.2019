I know that buying bottled water is stupid.

I used to think that I liked the way Poland Spring tasted. But the truth of the matter is that I can't really tell the difference between one bottled water and another. I can, however, tell the difference between the well water in Sherborn, the town water in Natick, and that fishy water in Brookline. It's not that I like the way bottled water tastes. It's that I don't like the way tap water tastes.

So when I ran across the [Bobble](https://waterbobble.com) on Kevin Kelly's [Cool Tools](https://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/004394.php), I thought I'd try one. I mean, it was the cost of about 6 or 7 bottles of Poland Spring. If I avoided buying that much bottled water over the course of my trial, it was worth it.

The Bobble is a reusable plastic water bottle with an integrated (replaceable) carbon filter. Pretty much the same thing that's in the Brita filters you get in the store. It's kind of a cool shape, and the filter comes in assorted colors, if you care about such things. I don't; that's why I got the red one.

As with most things that you make at home to take with you (coffee, lunch), the hardest thing to remember was to fill up the Bobble before I left the house. (The second hardest thing was to not smirk every time I said "Bobble" in my head.) Once I got past that, it was easy. I filled it up at home, at the synagogue, at the library, pretty much everywhere I went. The water tasted uniformly pleasant. It takes a little while to get used to the way the water comes out -- you have to squeeze harder than you'd imagine.

I flew with the Bobble. Just make sure that you empty it before you go through TSA. And considering the price of bottled water on the other side of the checkpoint, it's a good deal.

But the true test was using water that I knew tasted bad. In this particular venue, the water has the metallic taste of old pipes used too infrequently. I filled up my Bobble with this water, and I drank. It was good. Not Maine good. But pretty good.

You can get a pack of six from Amazon as well as single bottles from other vendors.
