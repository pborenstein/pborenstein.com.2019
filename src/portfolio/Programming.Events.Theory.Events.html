VisionPro objects fire, or raise, events to let your application know that something has 
happened or that the state of an object has changed. In order to be notified when an event
occurs, your application uses event handlers. VisionPro objects call 
your event handlers when the events fire.
</p>
<p>
This topic describes the kinds of events that VisionPro classes can fire and how you should write your event handlers. You can learn more about events in <a href="ms-help://MS.VSCC.2003/MS.MSDNQTR.2003FEB.1033/cpguide/html/cpconevents.htm">Handling and Raising Events</a> in the  <i>.NET Framework Developer's Guide</i>.

<h1><a name="#changed_events"></a>Changed Events</h1>
<p>
	The most common type of event fired by a VisionPro object is a changed event. Changed events are used by 
	VisionPro objects to indicate that the state of the object has changed. For example, when you change 
	the <a href="ms-its:ProgrammingReference.chm::/Cognex.VisionPro.ICogAcqBrightness.Brightness.html">brightness</a> of an <a href="ms-its:ProgrammingReference.chm::/Cognex.VisionPro.ICogAcqFifo.html">ICogAcqFifo</a> it fires a <a href="ms-its:ProgrammingReference.chm::/Cognex.VisionPro.ICogChangedEvent.Changed.html">Changed</a> event  that you can handle if you want to do something in response to the change or ignore if you do not. 
	</p>
<h2><a name="#visionpro_object_state"></a>VisionPro Object State</h2>
<p>	
	A VisionPro 
	object's state is 
	made up of all of the attributes of that object. Much of an object's state is contained in its 
	various properties. An object's state also 
	includes items that are returned by an object's methods (such as result graphics).
	</p>
<p>
	Each part of an object's state (each individual 
	piece of information that you can obtain by calling
	a property getter function or a method) has a unique <b>state flag</b>.
	State flags are read-only bit flags that VisionPro passes to an event handler so that it can
	determine what changed.
	The name of the field corresponds to affected state item.
	State flags are defined as fields within a class, such as the fields
	of <a href="ms-its:ProgrammingReference.chm::/Cognex.VisionPro.CogCircle.html">CogCircle</a>,
	or as fields in a class of their own, such as <a href="ms-its:ProgrammingReference.chm::/Cognex.VisionPro.CogAcqFifoStateFlags.html">CogAcqFifoStateFlags</a>.
	Typically, state flags that pertain to a single class are defined within a class, and state flags the pertain to
	several interfaces and classes are defined in their own class.
	</p>
<h2><a name="#state_change"></a>State Change</h2>
<p>
	Whenever the state of a VisionPro object changes, that object fires a 
	<a href="ms-its:ProgrammingReference.chm::/Cognex.VisionPro.ICogChangedEvent.Changed.html">Changed</a> event which invokes
	a <a href="ms-its:ProgrammingReference.chm::/Cognex.VisionPro.ChangedEventHandler.html">changed event handler</a> that you define.
	Following the .NET convention for event handlers, the first argument is the object that raised the event, and
	the second argument is an object that describes the change. In the case of changed events in VisionPro,
	this is a <a href="ms-its:ProgrammingReference.chm::/Cognex.VisionPro.CogChangedEventArgs.html">CogChangedEventArgs</a> object. It has a
	<a href="ms-its:ProgrammingReference.chm::/Cognex.VisionPro.ChangedEventArgs.StateFlags.html">StateFlags</a> field what  tells your application 
	what it needs to know about the new state of the object.  
	</p>
<p>
The value of the <a href="ms-its:ProgrammingReference.chm::/Cognex.VisionPro.ChangedEventArgs.StateFlags.html">StateFlags</a> field
of a <a href="ms-its:ProgrammingReference.chm::/Cognex.VisionPro.CogChangedEventArgs.html">CogChangedEventArgs</a> is set to the bitwise OR of every
state flag that corresponds to a changed state item.
</p>
<h2><a name="#using_changed_events"></a>Using Changed Events</h2>
<p>
How you use changed events depends in large part on why you are using changed events. A 
<a href="ms-its:UsersGuide.chm::/Programming.Events.CodeWalkthrough.UseChangeEvents.html">typical example</a> 
is  to use a changed event to acquire a new image whenever certain acquisition FIFO properties 
change. There are two steps in writing a changed event handler.</p>
<p>First, associate a changed event handler with the changed event:</p>
<pre class="code">
myAcqFifo.Changed += new CogChangedEventHandler(myAcqFifo_Changed);
</pre>
<p>Second, write the event handler itself:</p>
<pre class="code">
private void myAcqFifo_Changed(object sender, CogChangedEventArgs e) {
    int tNum;

    if ( (e.StateFlags &amp; CogAcqFifoStateFlags.SfBrightness) != 0)
        System.Console.WriteLine("Brightness changed");
    if ( (e.StateFlags &amp; CogAcqFifoStateFlags.SfContrast) != 0)
        System.Console.WriteLine("Contrast changed");

    cogDisplay1.Image = ((ICogAcqFifo) sender).Acquire(out tNum);
}
</pre>
<p>
When your event handler is executes, you can 
examine the <a href="ms-its:ProgrammingReference.chm::/Cognex.VisionPro.CogChangedEventArgs.html">changed event argument</a>
to determine how the state has changed. You can also cast  the <i>sender</i> argument to the appropriate type
to examine the object that raised the event.
</p>
<p class="note"><b>Note: </b>
		If you are using QuickBuild and using your own changed event handler, bear in mind that QuickBuild may change properties
		(such as triggering) that may invoke your changed even handler. Your changed event handler must be able to handle this case.
	</p>
<p>
Keep in mind that events fired in VisionPro objects that are part of VisionPro tools do not propagate 
to the tool. If you are working with VisionPro tools and you want to handle changed events from the 
component objects within the tool, you must set up separate changed event handlers for the component
objects.</p>
<h2><a name="#suspending_changed_events"></a>Suspending Changed Events</h2>
<p>
If you are making many changes to an object, you may not want to receive a changed event for every property you change.
In these cases, you can use
<a href="ms-its:ProgrammingReference.chm::/Cognex.VisionPro.ICogChangedEvent.SuspendChangedEvent.html">SuspendChangedEvent</a>  to keep changed events from firing.
When you call 
<a href="ms-its:ProgrammingReference.chm::/Cognex.VisionPro.ICogChangedEvent.ResumeAndRaiseChangedEvent.html">ResumeAndRaiseChangedEvent</a>,
and at least one event would have fired during the time events were suspended,
a single changed event fires.
</p>
<h1><a name="#tool_events"></a>Tool Events</h1>
<p>
Each VisionPro tool implements the <a href="ms-its:ProgrammingReference.chm::/Cognex.VisionPro.ICogTool.html">ICogTool</a> interface which includes two
tool-related events. All VisionPro tools fire these events under the same conditions. The 
VisionPro tool group framework makes use of these events to manage the updating of data links between 
the tools in a tool group. Your application can use these events to help manage the execution of tools and 
tool groups, and it can use these events to modify the results produced by individual tools during the 
execution of a tool group.
 </p>
<p>
The following table describes the individual tool events.

				Note that the <a href="ms-its:ProgrammingReference.chm::/Cognex.VisionPro.CogToolGroup.html">CogToolGroup</a> class uses this event to update data links between tools in the tool group. If your application sinks this event, it may be called before or after the links are updated. If you want to use 
an event to modify tool results, use the <a href="ms-its:ProgrammingReference.chm::/Cognex.VisionPro.ICogChangedEvent.Changed.html">Changed</a> event.</p>

<h1><a name="#acquisition_events"></a>Acquisition Events</h1>
<p>The VisionPro acquisition system implements three events that fire during the image acquisition process. </p>
<p>The <a href="ms-its:ProgrammingReference.chm::/Cognex.VisionPro.ICogChangedEvent.Changed.html">Changed</a> event fires when an acquisition FIFO property is changed.</p>
<p>The <a href="ms-its:ProgrammingReference.chm::/Cognex.VisionPro.ICogAcqFifo.Flushed.html">Flushed</a> event fires when an acquisition FIFO is flushed.</p>
<p>The <a href="ms-its:ProgrammingReference.chm::/Cognex.VisionPro.ICogAcqFifo.MovePart.html">MovePart</a> event fires after the camera has integrated the image, but (possibly) before it is available in video memory. When this event fires, it is safe to change the scene visible by the camera. The move part event has two parameters: the ticket of the acquisition request and a trigger sequence number..
 </p>
<p>The <a href="ms-its:ProgrammingReference.chm::/Cognex.VisionPro.ICogAcqFifo.Complete.html">Complete</a> event fires when an acquisition has been completed and the image may be available. (The complete event fires even if an image is not available when the acquisition times out.) The complete event has two parameters: the ticket of the acquisition request that is being completed and a trigger sequence number.
</p>
<p>The <a href="ms-its:ProgrammingReference.chm::/Cognex.VisionPro.ICogAcqFifo.Overrun.html">Overrun</a> event fires when an acquisition fails because, even though the acquisition system was able to obtain the required resources, it was unable to start the acquisition in a timely fashion. Either a trigger was detected but the acquisition system could not start the acquisition, or trigger signals arrived faster than the acquisition system could handle them. The overrun event has two parameters: the ticket that indicates whether a trigger was missed or whether the acquisition was overrun and a trigger sequence number.
</p>
<h1><a name="#collection_events"></a>Collection Events</h1>
<p>
Most of VisionPro's collection classes, such as <a href="ms-its:ProgrammingReference.chm::/Cognex.VisionPro.CogGraphicCollection.html">CogGraphicCollection</a> and  <a href="ms-its:ProgrammingReference.chm::/Cognex.VisionPro.CogStringCollection.html">CogStringCollection</a>, as well as the ones that provide multiple parameters to vision tools,
such as  <a href="ms-its:ProgrammingReference.chm::/Cognex.VisionPro.Blob.CogBlobMeasureCollection.html">CogBlobMeasureCollection</a> and <a href="ms-its:ProgrammingReference.chm::/Cognex.VisionPro.Caliper.CogCaliperScorers.html">CogCaliperScorers</a>,
fire  <a href="ms-its:ProgrammingReference.chm::/Cognex.VisionPro.ICogCollectionEvents.html">ICogCollectionEvents</a>.
</p>
<p>
Collection events come in pairs. One fires before an operation, and the other fires after an operation. For example, the
<a href="ms-its:ProgrammingReference.chm::/Cognex.VisionPro.ICogCollectionEvents.Clearing.html">Clearing</a> event fires before a collection is cleared, and the
<a href="ms-its:ProgrammingReference.chm::/Cognex.VisionPro.ICogCollectionEvents.Cleared.html">Cleared</a> event fires after a collection is cleared.
Depending on your application, you may want to handle either or both kinds of events.
</p>
<p>

<h1><a name="#interactive_shape_events"></a>Interactive Shape Events</h1>
<p>
All of the VisionPro shapes fire changed events when you make a change to their properties. For instance, if you change a circle's <a href="ms-its:ProgrammingReference.chm::/Cognex.VisionPro.CogCircle.CenterX.html">CenterX</a> and <a href="ms-its:ProgrammingReference.chm::/Cognex.VisionPro.CogCircle.CenterY.html">CenterY</a> properties, two changed events will fire, one for each property (unless you have <a href="ms-its:UsersGuide.chm::/Programming.Events.Theory.Events.html#suspending_change_events">suspended changed events</a>). If you set the circle's <a href="ms-its:ProgrammingReference.chm::/Cognex.VisionPro.CogCircle.Interactive.html">Interactive</a> property and drag it, a changed event fires if its location or radius is changed. 
</p>
<p>
Interactive shapes can also fire events as they are dragged. The 
<a href="ms-its:ProgrammingReference.chm::/Cognex.VisionPro.ICogGraphicInteractive.Dragging.html">Dragging</a> event fires as the shape is being moved or resized with the mouse.
The event handler's <a href="ms-its:ProgrammingReference.chm::/Cognex.VisionPro.CogDraggingEventArgs.html">CogDraggingEventArgs</a> argument provides a
<a href="ms-its:ProgrammingReference.chm::/Cognex.VisionPro.CogDraggingEventArgs.DragGraphic.html">DragGraphic</a> property that contains the shape that would result if dragging ended.
The
  event fires when you release the mouse button. 
The event handler's
<a href="ms-its:ProgrammingReference.chm::/Cognex.VisionPro.CogDraggingEventArgs.html">CogDraggingEventArgs</a> argument provides a
<a href="ms-its:ProgrammingReference.chm::/Cognex.VisionPro.CogDraggingEventArgs.DragGraphic.html">DragGraphic</a> property that contains the shape that resulted from dragging the original shape.

<p>The <a href="ms-its:ProgrammingReference.chm::/Cognex.VisionPro.Display.CogDisplay.html">CogDisplay</a> control fires events in response to
	changes in the state of the control and in response to user actions such as mouse clicks and keyboard presses.
	</p>
<p>The 
		<a href="ms-its:ProgrammingReference.chm::/Cognex.VisionPro.ICogChangedEvent.Changed.html">Changed</a>  event fires whenever there is a change to the
		state of the display control itself. For instance, this event fires when you make scroll bars visible or invisible or
		when you change the display's zoom factor.

The following table lists the events that the Display Control fires in response to mouse actions:
