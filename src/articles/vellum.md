Some twenty or thirty pages in, I lost track of where I was,  
but not in that "lost in a good book" way. Something to do with a book. And something to do with [Inanna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inanna).

I may have to create a new category for this kind of book: _Books I'm Not Sure I Started_.
