We're spending a couple of days in Seattle after our Alaska cruise, so of course we walked around Pike Place Market yesterday. The highlight of that stroll was running across [Dandelion Junk Queens](https://dandelionjunkqueens.tk/).

The song they were playing was [Dear Junk Beach](https://www.freewebs.com/dandelionjunkqueens/mp3/dearjunkbeach.mp3).
