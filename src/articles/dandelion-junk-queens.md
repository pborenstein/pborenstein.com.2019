We're spending a couple of days in Seattle after our Alaska cruise, so of course we walked around Pike Place Market yesterday. The highlight of that stroll was running across [Dandelion Junk Queens](https://dandelionjunkqueens.tk/).

The song they were playing was [Dear Junk Beach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkrUpgF6tEc).
