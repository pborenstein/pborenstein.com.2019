# Morgan's Dev Center Usability Results

- Sending first envelope is not easy
- Sandbox didn't look like a sandbox
- Getting from sandbox to dev center -- back and forth
- getting started & sandbox -- lots of back and forth
- Got to getting started because it's the landing page for Guides
- IK guide is hard to follow
- Getting Started uses templates
	- Nomenclature inconsistent
	- Instructions asked them to create the template (yuck)
	- Users don't know what an envelope is, let alone a template
- Lots of info there, but there's a lot of back and forth between docs, examples, instructions
- usability.gov "System Usability Scale"
- SUS > 68 is good. Below that not so good. ours: 30 - 56
- Only 1 of 13 was able to actually send an Envelope
- Overall perception is that the API is difficult to use
- API Office Hours? Biweekly? When where?
- Authentication is a problem for people.
- Erin: Principles overall
- developer dashboard that shows dev's performance
- Some things to do
	- GS overhaul
	- Conceptual concepts
	- Graphics of how it all goes
- Devs get lost and start "frantically clicking" until they it a graphic, and then keep going
- Validation steps: You'll know it worked ifâ€¦
- Support pages? Link to? Where? Oh-- the enduser doc
