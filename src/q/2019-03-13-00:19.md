Eliana sometimes wondered how she ended up sitting by a phone in the 21st century. Six months ago or was it five? It felt like a really long time doing something that was fun or even when not fun, engaging. But this. This was just--

A message from Jack. He was usually quick. One or two sentences. Usually an observation or a half assed attempt at an aphorism. But as one of Jack's messages said: "at the end of the day, it is what it is."

green car
plaid even
half on the sidewalk

He wanted it on three services.
Of course none of them had kappas with each other
and without the copy-paste-agreement she was going to have to type this for each service
