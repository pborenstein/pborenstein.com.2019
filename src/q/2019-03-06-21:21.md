At this point in my time I need to be center of attention. I constantly give out more than I get in and I'm emotionally/]physically drained. I don't hav what it takes for most relationships so this is perfect


one of those things I might have said
the thing that makes it suspect is "I constantly give out more than I get in". That's not really the kind of thing I'd say. Plus: It feels out of character for me to use "constantly" as a whine.
