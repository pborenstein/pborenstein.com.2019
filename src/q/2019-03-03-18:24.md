```
Poems are embarrassing

No sane person would write a poem
It’s embarrassing
Like recounting a dream
But in a dream
Using the language of dreams
Using the logic of dreams

It’s presumptuous
Like finger painting
Who does that

By playing with sounds and rhythms
You hope you can get that across 

You want someone to be in awe of your thoughts
The same way you are

And that is so dumb
Like wishing that someone
Enjoys smelling your farts 
As much as you do

Well that went nasty quickly
```
