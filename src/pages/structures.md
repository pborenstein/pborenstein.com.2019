OK, so.

When you want to create a new collection that's not
a tag, you can use `addCollection()` in your
`.eleventy.js` configuration file.

`addCollection()` takes two arguments:
- the name of the collection (a string)
- a function that takes a `collection` as an argument.


```js
  eleventyConfig.addCollection("articles", function(collection) {
    return collection.getAllSorted().filter(function(item) {
      return item.url && item.inputPath.startsWith('./src/articles/');
    });
  });
```

So, what's in this `collection` parameter?

| Property | Type | Description |
| :---     | :--- | :---        |
| items | [`item`] | All of the templates that Eleventy processed. Is this always the same as the number of pages? |
| sortAscending | Boolean | ? Whether the items are sorted in ascending order? |
| sortNumeric | Boolean | ? Whether the items are sorted in numeric order? |
| sortFunctionStringMap | object | Something to do with the sorting stuff. We're not going to talk about it here. |

We're going to look at what an `item` looks like.[^thing]

[^thing]: I'm using the notation `[item]` to indicate that
      the property called `items` is an array of item objects.
      There really isn't an `item` object. In other words,
      you'll never see JSON like this:

      ```json
      {
        "item" : { ... }
      }
      ```

<div class="mdhack"></div>

| Property | Type | Description |
| :---     | :--- | :---        |
| template | object | Content and metadata about this item's template. In other words, its page. |
| inputPath | string | A path relative to the source directory. Though really it's more like `./src/index.md` where `src` is the source directory. |
| fileSlug | string | The base name of the input file. The final element in the path. Never `index`. If the file is index.md, the slug is an empty string. |
| data | object | Whoa |
| date | string | An the file's date in <span style="font-variant-caps: small-caps; font-variant: small-caps">ISO 8601</span> format. There's some trickery about dates. |
| _pages | [`stuff`] | Something to do with Elventy's caching that I'm not even going to think about. |
| url | string | The URL of this page. Actually just the path without the scheme, host, port info etc. |
| outputPath | string | Where the processed file ended up. Relative to where `.eleventy.js` is |
