# {{ title }}

There was a time when I looked at websites.

I don't anymore.

I'm not happy about it.

## What happened

What I _thought_ happened:
- [Google Reader went away][],
- the replacements didn't quite work,
- but Twitter filled in pretty well
- then they screwed up retweeting,
- then Facebook,
- and silos.

But the timeline looks like this:

- Google Reader: 2005 -- 2013
- Feedly: 2008 --
- Twitter: 2006 --
- Facebook: 2006 --

So that's not happened. Reader overlapped with
Twitter and
Facebook for most of its life.

According to [this Wired article][wired],
Google killed Reader because its numbers
were down, also because:

> "As a culture we have moved into a realm where the consumption of news is a near-constant process,” says Richard Gingras, Senior Director, News & Social Products at Google. “Users with smartphones and tablets are consuming news in bits and bites throughout the course of the day – replacing the old standard behaviors of news consumption over breakfast along with a leisurely read at the end of the day.”

and

> Google Reader, and other RSS readers, subscribe to this "old" model. You sit, you pore through the day’s news link by link. Yes, some people are glued to their readers constantly. (Guilty!) And yes, you can use an app like Feedly to get your RSS fix on the go, but it’s a passive news-getting experience. With its updates to Now and Plus, Google wants its readers to take this more active approach to news consumption.

I used to use Google Reader to organize the
sites I looked at.
Some sites I read right in Google Reader,
but I still looked at the actual site
from time to time.

I don't think that
it was the case that there wasn't
a good replacement for Reader.

Before Reader there was Bloglines.
What happened there? [Boom].

But somehow, when Reader went away,
the replacements didn't quite feel the same.
Did they have similar feature sets?
What was it that made it difficult to switch to from Reader?

## Why Twitter & Facebook stopped working

For a while, Facebook and Twitter, especially Twitter,
made a pretty good substitute.
Instead of following _sites_ you were interested in,
you followed interesting _people_ instead.



## What now

## Notes

- tired of writing stuff on platforms that are hard to link to
- I would never link to a FB post -- mine or someone else's
- AAMOF: where do I even post links? Twitter & Facebook
- I'm posting links to ephemeral places from ephemeral platforms
- FB sure isn't searchable, not even for your own posts.
- Like a [commonplace book] to put things I need:
  - ready access to
  - to share with others
- [Such as]:
  - notes on tech I use
  - notes on tech I'm learning or playing with
  - my resume & portfolio
  - things I'm thinking about
