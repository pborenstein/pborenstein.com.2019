# {{ title }}

I keep wasting time posting things
in places that are hard to get to.
My own stuff is locked away in
one silo or another.
Not that my tweets and Facebook posts
have any enduring value,
but I should have control of my own stuff.

Specifically, I want something like
a [commonplace book]
that I can use
for things I need ready access to
or that I want to be able to share.
Things like:
  - notes on tech I use
  - notes on things I'm learning or playing with
  - my resume & portfolio
  - things I'm thinking about
