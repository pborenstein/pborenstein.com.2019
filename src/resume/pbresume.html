<h3>Cognex</h3>

<p>Apr 1996 &#8212; Nov 2008</p>

<h4>Principal Technical Writer</h4>

<p>During the 12 years that I worked in Cognex’s
Technical Publications department, the company evolved
and changed from a company that provided vision
software to support its hardware offerings to a company
that focused on software and low-cost sensors. As the
company’s products changed, so did its technical
documentation needs.</p>

<p>I wrote API documentation for two major vision class
libraries. The libraries had C++, C#, and Visual Basic
interfaces. In addition to describing functionality, I wrote
sample code in all three languages. I also wrote many of the
tools that we used to generate the documentation in several
formats.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cognex.com/products/machine-vision/cognex-vision-library/">CVL</a> (Cognex Vision Library) is a large C++ class library made
up of nearly 600 classes designed for OEM semiconductor
inspection applications. My work on this library included:</p>

<ul>
<li>Documenting most of the early classes for various vision tools,
image acquisition, and image display.</li>
<li>Creating a tool to parse C++ header files to extract
function signatures and generate ready-to-use
FrameMaker templates.</li>
<li>Designing the layout and FrameMaker templates for the
printed documentation.</li>
<li>Writing a tool to help discover instances where developers
had added new members to classes to make sure the
documentation was up to date.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://www.cognex.com/products/machine-vision/visionpro-vision-software/">VisionPro</a> is Cognex’s flagship general purpose vision
software product. It provides both an interactive
development environment as well as a rich .NET-based
vision library.</p>

<ul>
<li>I documented the API for most of the classes, and
created examples and code snippets for most of the methods.</li>
<li>Wrote conceptual documentation and how-to guides
to help customers learn how to use and combine parts
of the library.</li>
<li>VisionPro was originally a COM product. With other
members of the team, I wrote a set of tools that used
reflection to generate base documentation from COM-based
libraries. When VisionPro moved to the .NET architecture,
I wrote tools to generate a new .NET version of the
documentation and then keeping both the COM and .NET
versions in sync. (The COM version was eventually dropped.)</li>
<li>The COM VisionPro documentation source existed as
a set of over 20,000 XML files. We wrote custom tools to
generate CHMs for the VisionPro documentation. For the
move to .NET, I adapted NDoc, an open source documentation
generator, to use our legacy XML files as well as
new C#-generated documentation XML files. We wrote tools
to generate HTML, CHM, and HxS versions of the documentation.</li>
<li>I optimized our build process so that we were
able to build complete documentation sets
in under an hour instead of three or four hours.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to working on documentation for Cognex’s
vision software class libraries, I also wrote and
maintained several tools used by both projects.</p>

<ul>
<li>I wrote an XML-based application to maintain release notes for
both VisionPro and CVL.
This application generated HTML for inclusion
in customer documentation and another version
for internal use.
The internal version
included links to the bug database, noted when a bug appeared and
when it was closed, and could be use to generate historical
versions of the release notes.</li>
<li>I maintained a camera database that began as a simple table
and later became an XML-based file similar to the release notes
database. This became the single place where there was a
historical record of which cameras were supported in which
release of each software product. I taught myself MS Access and
SQL to reimplement this application as an Access database and
transferred responsibility of the database to engineering.
The marketing department used this database to
generate a list of compatible cameras on the Cognex web site.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Freelance</h3>
